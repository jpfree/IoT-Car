# Ever wanted to make a robot without range limits?
Why not use the internet to control the robot?
In this project, I have made a car which can be controlled over the internet. You can literally control the robot from anywhere on the earth. All you need is just an internet connection.

# ESP8266 based IoT-Car
## [UPDATE: 06 July 2020]
### 1. This project does not require the Arduino Json library anymore. 
### 2. The Firebase library has been updated and now there are no more restrictions and bugs associated with it.
### 3. The new Firebase library requires a Project ID instead of Hosting URL and Token.
## You can find the Project ID under the project settings page. You need to change the database ".read" and ".write" rules to 'true'. Avoiding this will result in an error. You can find the more details here- https://github.com/Rupakpoddar/ESP8266Firebase/blob/master/README.md
